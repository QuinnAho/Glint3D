description: >
  Implement a WebGPU backend using wgpu-native (and/or Dawn) targeting desktop and
  enabling future web builds. Ensure API parity with the WebGPU-shaped RHI frontend.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "WebGPU backend compiles and runs core scenes"
  - "GL vs WebGPU image diff < epsilon on 10â€“20 golden scenes"
  - "Pass/encoder/bind group semantics match frontend expectations"

must_requirements:
  - TEST.CROSS_PLATFORM
  - TEST.GOLDEN_SSIM
  - PERF.FRAME_BUDGET
