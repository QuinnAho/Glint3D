description: >
  Implement comprehensive performance profiling framework with per-pass timing,
  memory tracking, and automated performance regression detection. Addresses
  performance budget enforcement identified in the refactoring plan.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Per-pass GPU timing with microsecond precision"
  - "Memory usage tracking for textures, buffers, and scene data"
  - "Performance budgets enforced (16ms frame time, memory limits)"
  - "Automated performance regression detection in CI"
  - "Real-time performance HUD for development"

must_requirements:
  - PERF.FRAME_BUDGET
  - PERF.MEMORY_BUDGET
  - TEST.UNIT_COVERAGE
  - API.PUBLIC_HEADERS_PATH

  - Performance HUD for real-time monitoring
  - CI performance regression testing

performance_budgets: >
  Frame Time Budgets (1080p):
  - Interactive editing: 16ms (60fps)
  - Final rendering: 100ms per frame acceptable
  - Pass breakdown: GBuffer(4ms), Lighting(8ms), Post(2ms), Overhead(2ms)
  
  Memory Budgets:
  - Small scene (< 1M triangles): 100MB
  - Large scene (< 10M triangles): 500MB
  - Per-feature overhead: 50MB max
  - Texture cache: 1GB desktop, 256MB web

profiling_features: >
  CPU Profiling:
  - Function-level timing with call stack
  - Memory allocation tracking
  - Thread contention analysis
  
  GPU Profiling:
  - Pass-level GPU timing
  - Resource binding overhead
  - Shader compilation time
  - VRAM usage tracking

current_problems:
  - "No visibility into performance bottlenecks"
  - "Performance regressions detected only by users"
  - "Memory usage not tracked, leading to OOM on large scenes"
  - "No frame budget enforcement during development"
  - "GPU timing data not available for optimization"

target_architecture: >
  Comprehensive profiling framework integrated into RHI and RenderGraph,
  with real-time HUD, automated budget validation, and CI regression testing.
  Enables data-driven performance optimization and prevents regressions.
