description: >
  Add compute pipeline support (pipeline, bind groups, dispatch) and storage buffers (read/write)
  aligned with WebGPU. Implement in GL backend via appropriate extensions/paths.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "ComputePipeline and dispatch supported in RHI"
  - "Storage buffers (read/write) in bind groups"
  - "Unit tests cover basic compute + buffer readback"

must_requirements:
  - TEST.CROSS_PLATFORM
  - API.PUBLIC_HEADERS_PATH
