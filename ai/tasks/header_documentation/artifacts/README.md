# Header Documentation Task Artifacts

This directory contains all deliverables and outputs generated during the header documentation task.

## Expected Artifacts

### Documentation (`documentation/`)
- **header_audit.md** - Complete audit of all header files with current documentation status
- **documentation_coverage_report.md** - Final coverage report showing which headers have been documented and verification results

### Validation (`validation/`)
- **documentation_validation.json** - JSON report containing validation results for all headers against FOR_MACHINES.md ยง0C checklist

### Code (`code/`)
- Not applicable for this task (headers are modified in place)

### Tests (`tests/`)
- Not applicable for this task

## Naming Conventions

All artifacts follow these naming patterns:
- Audit files: `header_audit.md`
- Coverage reports: `documentation_coverage_report.md`
- Validation results: `documentation_validation.json`

## Validation Requirements

Each artifact must meet these criteria:
1. **header_audit.md**: Lists all 64 headers with current state (missing/incomplete/complete)
2. **documentation_coverage_report.md**: Shows final coverage percentage and lists all completed headers
3. **documentation_validation.json**: Contains pass/fail status for each acceptance criterion

## Generation Process

Artifacts are generated automatically during task execution:
1. Phase 1 generates `header_audit.md`
2. Phase 9 generates `documentation_coverage_report.md` and `documentation_validation.json`
3. All artifacts must exist before task can be marked complete
