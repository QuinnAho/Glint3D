# FEAT-0241 — SSR-T refraction in raster preview

## Intent (human summary)
Implement Screen-Space Refraction with Transmission (SSR-T) in the rasterized pipeline to enable real-time glass material previews without requiring raytracing mode. This eliminates the current limitation where users must remember to use `--raytrace` for glass materials, and enables the hybrid auto mode to intelligently choose between raster previews and raytraced finals.

The core architectural change introduces a unified MaterialCore struct that eliminates the current dual material storage problem (PBR + legacy Material causing conversion drift), and layers SSR-T on top of the existing RHI abstraction.

## AI-Editable: Implementation Notes

### Key Discovery: Existing Implementation Foundation
The codebase already contains substantial groundwork:
- **MaterialCore**: Internal implementation exists in `engine/include/material_core.h`
- **RHI Layer**: Complete RHI abstraction with OpenGL/Null backends in `engine/include/rhi/`
- **Dual Storage**: SceneObject clearly shows the problem with separate `Material material` and PBR factors

### MaterialCore Design Decisions
- **Public API**: Created `engine/include/glint3d/material_core.h` with comprehensive documentation
- **Namespace Isolation**: Using `glint3d::MaterialCore` vs internal `MaterialCore` 
- **Field Layout**: Optimized for cache-friendly access with core properties first
- **Factory Functions**: Convenience constructors for common material types (metal, glass, emissive)
- **Migration Support**: Conversion functions from/to legacy Material and PBR systems

### RHI Interface Scope Completed
- **Public API**: Created `engine/include/glint3d/rhi.h` and `rhi_types.h`
- **Backend Support**: OpenGL 3.3+, WebGL2, planned Vulkan/WebGPU
- **Type Safety**: Opaque handles prevent resource mix-ups
- **Performance**: Designed for <5% overhead vs direct GL calls
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive Doxygen documentation for all public APIs

### RESOLVED: Dual Storage Problem Migration
The dual storage issue in SceneObject has been successfully resolved:

**Before (Dual Storage):**
```cpp
struct SceneObject {
    Material material;           // Legacy (raytracer)
    glm::vec4 baseColorFactor;  // PBR (rasterizer) 
    float metallicFactor;       // PBR (rasterizer)
    float roughnessFactor;      // PBR (rasterizer) 
    float ior;                  // PBR (rasterizer)
};
```

**After (Unified MaterialCore):**
```cpp
struct SceneObject {
    MaterialCore materialCore;   // Unified BSDF for both pipelines
    Material material;           // Kept temporarily for raytracer compatibility (PR4 will eliminate)
};
```

**Key Changes Made:**
- ✅ SceneObject now uses unified MaterialCore as primary material storage
- ✅ JSON Ops system updated to write to MaterialCore and sync to legacy Material
- ✅ Render system updated to read from MaterialCore instead of individual PBR factors
- ✅ Transmission and thickness support added to JSON schema and operations
- ✅ Legacy Material kept temporarily for raytracer compatibility during transition
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests created covering BSDF calculations and edge cases  
- ✅ JSON schema extended with transmission and thickness for glass material support

**Next Steps for PR2:**
1. Update `platforms/desktop/main.cpp:260-266` to use `obj.materialCore` instead of old PBR fields
2. Complete RHI migration by routing render system calls through RHI interface
3. Add screen-space refraction pass foundation

### SSR-T Algorithm
- TBD: Screen-space ray step size vs quality tradeoffs
- TBD: Roughness-to-blur mapping for transmission
- TBD: Fallback strategy when rays miss geometry

## AI-Editable: Blockers and Risks

### Current Status: PR1 Foundation Complete with Minor Blocker
- ✅ **MaterialCore Integration**: SceneObject unified storage implemented 
- ✅ **RHI Public API**: Ready for RenderSystem migration  
- ✅ **JSON Ops Support**: Transmission and thickness fields added to schema
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive MaterialCore BSDF validation created
- ⚠️ **Platform Code Update Needed**: `platforms/desktop/main.cpp:260-266` still uses old PBR fields (outside whitelist)

### Remaining Risks for PR2-PR5
- **Migration Complexity**: SceneObject integration may reveal unexpected dependencies
- **Performance Impact**: SSR-T texture reads and blur passes need careful optimization
- **WebGL2 Limitations**: Texture format constraints may require fallback strategies
- **Quality vs Performance**: SSR-T may not match raytracing quality for complex refractive scenes
- **Testing Coverage**: Need comprehensive golden image tests for material consistency
