# Core Decomposition Checklist

## Manager Implementation

- [x] **CameraManager** - Camera state, view/projection matrices, viewport resize hooks
- [x] **LightingManager** - UBO lifecycle (binding point 1), Light properties extraction, spot light conversion
- [x] **MaterialManager** - UBO lifecycle (binding point 2), MaterialCore extraction, PBR workflow
- [x] **PipelineManager** - Centralized shader creation, pipeline caching, RHI management
- [x] **TransformManager** - UBO lifecycle (binding point 0), model/view/projection matrices
- [x] **RenderingManager** - UBO lifecycle (binding point 3), exposure/gamma/tone mapping

## Integration

- [x] **Manager Instantiation** - All managers instantiated with proper initialization/shutdown
- [x] **UBO System Migration** - Single UBO system, all UBOs managed exclusively by managers
- [x] **Binding Delegation** - `bindUniformBlocks()` delegates entirely to managers
- [x] **Legacy Cleanup** - Legacy UBO members removed from RenderSystem header
- [x] **RHI Integration** - RHI abstraction used throughout, GL fallbacks eliminated

## Framework

- [x] **RenderGraph** - Pass framework exists and executes
- [x] **Pass Context** - PassContext structure for pass communication
- [x] **Manager Access** - Managers accessible from passes via context

## Validation

- [x] **Build Success** - Project compiles and links successfully
- [x] **Runtime Stability** - Application runs without crashes
- [x] **Manager Isolation** - Each manager has clear responsibilities and boundaries
