## AI-Tunable Renderer Addendum

The current decomposition work is moving you closer to an AI-tunable renderer, but a few structural tweaks will make it friendlier for automated agents and self-improvement loops.

### Whatï¿½s Already Helpful
- Render graph + `PassContext` (`engine/include/render_pass.h:30-99`) gives you a declarative, inspectable pipeline; AI tooling can reason about passes as discrete nodes and inject instrumentation.
- RHI abstraction (`engine/include/glint3d/rhi.h:28-199`) isolates backends, so agents can swap configuration or simulate runs without diving into raw GL/WebGL.
- Manager split direction (`ai/tasks/render_system_decomposition.md`) recognises the need to decouple state (camera, lighting, materials) from the monolith, a prerequisite for parameter sweeps or targeted tuning.

### Where It Falls Short For AI Loops
- Monolithic `RenderSystem` (`engine/src/render_system.cpp:640-2200`) still hides most decisions and mutable state; an agent canï¿½t easily observe or override per-pass parameters without patching big functions.
- Pass methods are stubs (`engine/src/render_system.cpp:2462-2496`), so the graph is unusable. That forces everything through legacy code paths, blocking fine-grained intervention.
- No explicit parameter surfaces. Lighting/material/raster options live in member variables (e.g., `m_materialData`, `m_renderMode`) scattered through the class. Thereï¿½s no schema an AI can query/update atomically.
- Telemetry gaps. You collect per-pass timings (`RenderStats::passTimings`), but thereï¿½s no structured output for resource usage, shader variants, or error states that an optimisation loop could consume.
- Mixed responsibilities. Resource creation, frame orchestration, and policy (pipeline selection) are all glued together, making it harder to swap in AI-driven strategies.

### Adjustments To Enable AI Accessibility
1. Finish the manager refactor and extend it.
   - Promote `LightingManager`, `MaterialManager`, `PipelineManager` out of the TODO list so each exposes a small, serialisable state object (JSON/protobuf). That becomes the control surface for AI tuning.
   - Keep `RenderSystem` focused on orchestration; managers provide `getState()`/`applyState()` so agents can snapshot, mutate, and roll back experiments safely.
2. Make passes first-class modules.
   - Move the body of `renderRasterized`, `renderDebugElements`, etc., into the corresponding `pass*` methods (`engine/src/render_system.cpp:2482-2496`).
3. Introduce an explicit parameter registry.
   - Add a small `RenderConfig` service exposing a typed map of tweakable values (tone mapping mode, MSAA level, etc.).
4. Standardise telemetry.
   - Extend `RenderStats` (`engine/include/render_system.h:52-70`) with per-pass resource metrics and JSON serialisation. Emit one record per frame and per test scene so an optimiser can score changes automatically.
5. Provide scripting hooks.
   - Once the managers exist, expose them via your existing ops JSON or a lightweight RPC so an AI agent can, for example, set material roughness on object X to 0.3 without recompiling.

These adjustments align with Phases 1ï¿½3 above: complete the manager split (Phase 1), migrate real work into pass methods and the RenderGraph (Phase 1A/2), and add the parameter registry + telemetry + scripting surfaces as you remove legacy paths (Phase 2/3).
