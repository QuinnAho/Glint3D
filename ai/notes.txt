the whitelist disallowed main.cpp, which became a problem when we needed to edit it, if the AI determine it needs to edit that file
based off some sort of confidence interval, we should allow it to break the guards to do so.

We should add some requirements to test the build of the repo if not already implemented 

we need some folder like 'passes' where we have a prompt and requirements to do a QA pass, or a Debug Pass, or a new feature request

when the ai is coding, make sure it has the feature pointer in the comment somewhere so when ai passes over it they can gain insight on what it is doing via machine readable instructions

token alignment

tasks module

make it easy for ai to find things

create machine readable files for important scripts within your application

extensive debug checks
