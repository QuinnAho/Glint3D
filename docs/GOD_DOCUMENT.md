Glint3D is a data-oriented, modular rendering system built around a versioned JSON-Ops schema. All scenes, materials, lights, cameras, render passes, and schedules are defined as immutable machine-readable specs. A deterministic job system consumes these specs and executes a render graph (dependency-ordered passes with explicit resource edges) on top of a Render Hardware Interface (RHI).

The RHI is currently implemented with OpenGL/WebGL2 and is designed to support Vulkan/WebGPU next. All GPU features are accessed through the RHI abstraction. Rendering pipelines are built on top of this interface rather than as separate backends.

Resources such as buffers and textures are currently managed through standard allocation paths. Future versions will introduce handle tables and memory arenas for resource lifetime management, improving performance, reuse, and determinism at scale. A content-addressed cache (hash of asset + parameters) guarantees reproducible outputs and instant re-use in headless or batched runs. A deterministic PRNG seeds all sampling paths to ensure byte-stable results across platforms. All state changes occur through idempotent ops, with no hidden globals, making runs fully auditable and easy to diff.

Gaussian Splatting is a planned core rendering method. It will be implemented as a first-class render pass type inside the render graph and will run on top of the existing RHI. The splat pipeline will share the same resource model, lighting system, and scheduling as raster passes. In future versions, splats will be able to run early as low-cost preview passes, providing instant feedback while heavier assets stream in.

The scheduler supports both interactive and headless modes, with sandboxed and rate-limited op application for safety. Hot-reloadable shader packages (material DSL â†’ backend shaders) and RHI capability queries allow the same JSON-Op spec to adapt to different devices and backends at compile time.
