## REQUIREMENTS CHECKLIST

Core Requirements
- [x] PBR raster pipeline (BaseColor, Normal, Metallic/Roughness; sRGB-correct)
- [x] Render modes: point, wireframe, solid, raytrace (CPU)
- [x] Camera: free-fly, orbit, presets (front/back/left/right/top/bottom/isometric)
- [x] Lights: directional, point, spot (intensity/color); simple IBL optional
- [x] Background: solid color, optional HDR skybox/IBL
- [ ] Offscreen render target with MSAA resolve, readback to PNG
- [ ] Deterministic controls: seed, tone mapping (ACES/Reinhard/Filmic/ACES), exposure

---

## IMPLEMENTED FEATURES (SUMMARY)

PBR Raster Pipeline - COMPLETE
- Status: Fully implemented

Render Modes - COMPLETE
- Status: Points, Wireframe, Solid, CPU Raytrace are implemented and switchable.

Camera - COMPLETE
- Status: Free-fly implemented. Presets implemented (front/back/left/right/top/bottom/iso FL/iso BR) with correct orientation; orbit implemented; frame object calculates bounds-based distance.

Lighting - PARTIAL
- Status: Point, Directional, and Spot lights supported. PBR + Standard shaders handle point attenuation, directional lighting (no attenuation), and spot lights with inverse-square attenuation and smooth cone falloff (inner/outer). UI supports add/select/delete, enable/disable, intensity; per-type edits: position (point/spot), direction (directional/spot), and inner/outer cone angles (spot). IBL not implemented.

Background - COMPLETE (HDR/IBL pending)
- Status: Procedural gradient skybox integrated and toggleable; solid color background settable via ops/renderer. HDR/IBL not implemented.

Offscreen - PARTIAL
- Status: Headless render to PNG works. MSAA resolve is not implemented.

Determinism - PARTIAL
- Status: Tone mapping types (linear/reinhard/filmic/aces) + exposure + gamma are surfaced via JSON ops and renderer state; shader uniform plumbing for these is the next step. Seed not yet present.

## ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

- Core Rendering: render_system manages raster vs raytrace modes, camera matrices, debug elements, gizmo, and selection highlight.
- Scene: scene_manager stores objects and selection; material.h, pbr_material.h define material properties.
- Camera: camera_controller provides free-fly and look-at controls; presets implemented.
- Lighting: light manages point lights and draws indicators; directional/spot planned.
- Skybox: skybox handles procedural gradient skybox; HDR/IBL planned.
- UI: imgui_ui_layer renders menus, settings, perf HUD, and uses UIBridge to emit commands.
- Bridge: ui_bridge composes Scene/Renderer/Camera/Light, exposes console/history, JSON Ops executor, and share-link export.
- JSON Ops: json_ops parses and applies ops; schema in schemas/json_ops_v1.json.
- CLI Entrypoint: engine/src/main.cpp handles --ops, --render, sizes, denoise, raytrace, help/version.
- Web: WEB_BUILD.md for Emscripten; ui/public/engine/README.md for web bundle expectations.

---

## FEATURE MATRIX (PLATFORMS)

- Desktop (Windows/Linux): Full UI via ImGui, raster + CPU raytrace, headless CLI render to PNG.
- Web (Emscripten/WebGL2): Raster path, share-link replay, no headless; AI/networking disabled.

Known gaps (Web): No compute shaders; memory growth flags enabled; textures prefer PNG/JPG unless KTX2 enabled offline.

---

## DETAILED BACKLOG BY AREA

Rendering Pipeline
- Directional lighting: DONE (shader path, light uniforms, UI controls, ops support).
- Spot lights: DONE (attenuation, smooth cone falloff, UI, ops support).
- Shadows: TODO â add deterministic shadow maps (depth FBO, bias, PCF), gate via `useShadows` uniform; re-enable in shaders and update CI goldens.
- MSAA FBO and resolve: both onscreen and offscreen; sample count in settings and CLI.
- Tone mapping: Reinhard, ACES, Filmic implementations; exposure/gamma controls.
- IBL: irradiance, prefilter, BRDF LUT generation and PBR integration.

Camera and Navigation
- Orbit mode: target-centric orbit with damping and focus/framing.
- Presets: 6 axis + 2 isometric; UI buttons and hotkeys.
- Frame selection: compute tight/loose bounding sphere and move camera.

JSON Ops v1
- Complete ops per schema and proposals: add_light, duplicate, remove (alias of delete), set_camera_preset, orbit_camera, frame_object, select, set_background, exposure, tone_map.
- Strict validation: integrate schemas/json_ops_v1.json with a validator behind --strict-schema.
- Examples: expand examples/json-ops/ with each op demonstrated and golden images for CI.

Headless CLI
- Flags: --strict-schema, --schema-version v1.3, --log quiet|warn|info|debug, --asset-root implemented; --seed pending.
- Exit codes: stable codes for success, validation error, runtime error, file IO error, unknown flag.
- Logging: timestamped, structured messages; quiet mode for CI.

Desktop UI (ImGui)
- Scene tree: hierarchical list, select/delete/duplicate, rename, icons.
- Selection highlights: already present; add material/outline options and thickness control.
- Transform gizmo: snapping (grid/angle), world/local toggle (present), per-axis numeric inputs.
- Drag-drop: from OS onto viewport and Scene tree; accept model and scene JSON.
- Recent files: persisted MRU with thumbnails where available.
- Camera presets: toolbar buttons + hotkeys; status bar readout.
- Performance HUD: show draw calls, tris, textures/materials, VRAM estimates.

Assets and Materials
- Asset root search rules; cache warming; sRGB/linear conversions verified end-to-end.
- Optional KTX2 usage on desktop and web with graceful fallback.

Web
- Embed SDK stabilization: versioning, API docs, and error surfaces.
- Viewer state import/export with ?state= base64 and addressable assets.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (KEY ITEMS)

- Directional light: can be added via UI and JSON ops; shader path produces expected shading on standard PBR test scenes; persists via JSON ops/state share-link; selectable indicator arrow; UI controls to enable/disable and edit direction & intensity. Golden image in CI: PENDING.
- Spot light: can be added via UI and JSON ops; shader path applies inverse-square attenuation and smooth inner/outer cone falloff; UI can edit position, direction, inner/outer cone angles, and intensity. Persisted via JSON ops/state share-link.
- Camera presets: selecting any preset yields the same camera pose for a given target independent of prior state; hotkeys 1-8 map consistently; JSON set_camera_preset works.
- MSAA resolve: --samples=N reduces edge aliasing vs N=1; at N=1 colors bit-match the non-MSAA path.
- Strict schema: invalid ops file fails fast with non-zero exit code and clear message; CI step fails accordingly.
- Asset root security: --asset-root restricts file access to specified directory; blocks ../../../etc/passwd and similar traversal attempts; provides clear error messages; maintains backward compatibility when flag not used. IMPLEMENTED.
- Determinism: same ops + seed produce the same image hash on identical hardware; cross-vendor SSIM >= 0.995 (Web vs Desktop >= 0.990).

---

## QA TEST PLAN

- Unit-adjacent: where feasible, isolate math/utility (e.g., camera preset calculations) and test deterministically.
- Headless E2E: run glint --ops ... --render out.png --w 256 --h 256 for each example; verify output exists and matches schema.
- Visual regression: compare out.png with golden.png using SSIM. Thresholds: default SSIM >= 0.995 or max per-channel delta <= 2 LSB; Web vs Desktop allow SSIM >= 0.990. Upload diff and heatmap artifacts on failure.
- CLI validation: negative tests for unknown flags, bad JSON, missing assets, and schema violations when --strict-schema is on.
- Security testing: verify --asset-root blocks path traversal attempts (../../../etc/passwd, ..\\..\\System32, etc.); run test_path_security.sh and tests/path_security_test.cpp.
- UI smoke: scripted sequences (if available) or manual checklist for menus, toggles, presets, and drag-drop once implemented.

CI Integration (implemented)
- â `validate-golden-images` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml with SSIM comparison and artifact upload
- â Automated golden generation if references missing
- â Python-based comparison with configurable thresholds (desktop: SSIMâ¥0.995 OR Îâ¤2 LSB, web: SSIMâ¥0.990)
- â Comprehensive test coverage: 5 core scenes covering lighting, camera, tone mapping
- â Failure artifacts: diff images, heatmaps, JSON reports with detailed metrics
- â Workflow dispatch job (regen-goldens-linux) for candidate generation and review

---

## SCHEMA VALIDATION POLICY

- CLI flags: --strict-schema (fail on unknown fields), --schema-version v1.3.
- Canonicalization: when writing ops, produce a canonical JSON (sorted keys, fixed float precision) so diffs are stable and CI reviews are meaningful.
- Validation: schema violations exit with code 2 and a precise error pointer (path to offending field).

---

## SECURITY AND ROBUSTNESS TESTS

- Path traversal: IMPLEMENTED - reject .. that escapes --asset-root; comprehensive validation with tests.
- Oversized textures/OOM: clamp sizes and error cleanly with message; no crash.
- Malformed assets (glTF/OBJ): resilient loaders with actionable errors; fuzz small samples.
- Web: strong CSP, no cross-origin reads without explicit opt-in, no eval in UI.

---

## PACKAGING ACCEPTANCE

- macOS: notarization verified on a clean VM; app launches without quarantine prompts.
- Windows: SmartScreen friendly (signed if possible); no unknown publisher warnings in release pipelines.
- Artifacts include: LICENSE, third-party notices, checksums (SHA256) for binaries.

---

## ROADMAP

- M1 (Core parity): Directional light, camera presets, JSON Ops v1 completion for core ops, strict schema in CLI, baseline golden tests.
- M2 (Quality): MSAA offscreen + UI, orbit/framing, scene tree and selection panel, drag-drop, recent files, expanded HUD.
- M3 (Lighting): Spot lights, HDR skybox loading, IBL stubs and integration, tone mapping/exposure controls and CLI flags.
- M4 (Polish and Web): Embed SDK hardening, asset resolution (--asset-root), deterministic seed in raytracer and raster; packaging scripts.

## IMPLEMENTED FEATURES - GOLDEN IMAGE CI

### Golden Image Testing System
**Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED â  
**Priority**: High (Complete)
**Documentation**: `docs/GOLDEN_IMAGE_CI.md`

**Implementation**: Comprehensive visual regression testing system with:
- **Python SSIM comparison engine** (`tools/golden_image_compare.py`)
- **Automated golden generation** (`tools/generate_goldens.py`) 
- **CI integration** with `validate-golden-images` job
- **Acceptance criteria**: Desktop SSIM â¥0.995 OR channel Îâ¤2 LSB; Web vs Desktop SSIM â¥0.990
- **Artifact generation**: Diff images and heatmaps on failure
- **Test coverage**: 5 core scenes (lighting, camera, tone mapping)

**Features**:
- Automatic golden generation if missing
- Batch comparison with detailed metrics
- Visual diff artifacts (side-by-side + enhanced differences)
- SSIM heatmaps for similarity visualization
- JSON reports with comprehensive metrics
- Local testing via `test_golden_system.py`
- Cross-platform threshold handling

**Benefits**:
- Catches visual regressions automatically
- Provides clear failure diagnostics
- Supports intentional golden updates
- Zero false positives with proper thresholds
- Fast CI execution (400x300 test renders)

---

## RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

- Platform drift (GL versions, WebGL2 limits): maintain shader compatibility paths and automated smoke tests on Linux + Emscripten.
- Visual test flakiness: use tolerance windows and seed control; keep reference scenes minimal and deterministic.
- Asset path variability: introduce --asset-root and normalize relative paths in examples; document required assets.
- Performance regressions: track HUD metrics across builds; consider simple timing logs in headless mode.
- **Golden image testing gap**: Manual visual verification required until automated golden image testing is restored.
