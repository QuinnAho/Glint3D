## DETAILED STATUS AND PLANS

1. Camera Presets - HIGH PRIORITY
- Status: Done
- Estimated Effort: 2-3 hours

Requirements (proposal):
```
enum class CameraPreset {
  Front, Back, Left, Right, Top, Bottom,
  IsometricFront, IsometricBack
};
void setCameraPreset(CameraPreset preset, const glm::vec3& target = glm::vec3(0));
```

Plan
- Add preset enum and API to camera_controller.h/.cpp (DONE)
- Compute preset pos/rot around a target with consistent FOV (DONE)
- UI buttons + hotkeys (1-8) and JSON op set_camera_preset (JSON op DONE; UI buttons pending)

Preset Definitions (implemented; target=[0,0,0], up=[0,1,0]; distance chosen to frame bounding sphere using vertical FOV; defaults FOV=45Â°, margin=25% configurable via shared defaults)
- Front:  pos = [ 0, 0, +R]
- Back:   pos = [ 0, 0, -R]
- Left:   pos = [-R, 0,  0]
- Right:  pos = [+R, 0,  0]
- Top:    pos = [ 0, +R, 0]
- Bottom: pos = [ 0, -R, 0]
- IsoFL:  pos = normalize([-1,  1,  1]) * R

  LightType type;          // default Point
  glm::vec3 position;
  glm::vec3 direction;     // for Dir/Spot
  float spotCutoff;        // inner cone

  glm::vec3 color;
  float intensity;
  bool enabled;
};
```

- Status: Not implemented
- Estimated Effort: 3-4 hours

Plan
- Multisampled FBO and resolve path
- Use in renderToPNG() and expose sample count in UI/CLI

5. Deterministic Rendering Controls - LOW PRIORITY
- Status: Not implemented
- Estimated Effort: 4-5 hours

Requirements (proposal):
```
struct RenderSettings {
  uint32_t seed = 42;
  enum ToneMapping { Linear, Reinhard, ACES, Filmic } tone = Linear;
  float exposure = 1.0f;
  float gamma = 2.2f;

## ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

- Core Rendering: render_system manages raster vs raytrace modes, camera matrices, debug elements, gizmo, and selection highlight.
- Scene: scene_manager stores objects and selection; material.h, pbr_material.h define material properties.
- Camera: camera_controller provides free-fly and look-at controls; presets implemented.
- Lighting: light manages point lights and draws indicators; directional/spot planned.
- Skybox: skybox handles procedural gradient skybox; HDR/IBL planned.
- UI: imgui_ui_layer renders menus, settings, perf HUD, and uses UIBridge to emit commands.
- Bridge: ui_bridge composes Scene/Renderer/Camera/Light, exposes console/history, JSON Ops executor, and share-link export.
- JSON Ops: json_ops parses and applies ops; schema in schemas/json_ops_v1.json.
- CLI Entrypoint: engine/src/main.cpp handles --ops, --render, sizes, denoise, raytrace, help/version.
- Web: WEB_BUILD.md for Emscripten; ui/public/engine/README.md for web bundle expectations.

---

## FEATURE MATRIX (PLATFORMS)

- Desktop (Windows/Linux): Full UI via ImGui, raster + CPU raytrace, headless CLI render to PNG.
- Web (Emscripten/WebGL2): Raster path, share-link replay, no headless; AI/networking disabled.

Known gaps (Web): No compute shaders; memory growth flags enabled; textures prefer PNG/JPG unless KTX2 enabled offline.

---

## DETAILED BACKLOG BY AREA

Rendering Pipeline
- Directional lighting: DONE (shader path, light uniforms, UI controls, ops support).
- Spot lights: DONE (attenuation, smooth cone falloff, UI, ops support).
- MSAA FBO and resolve: both onscreen and offscreen; sample count in settings and CLI.
- Tone mapping: Reinhard, ACES, Filmic implementations; exposure/gamma controls.
- IBL: irradiance, prefilter, BRDF LUT generation and PBR integration.

Camera and Navigation
- Orbit mode: target-centric orbit with damping and focus/framing.
- Presets: 6 axis + 2 isometric; UI buttons and hotkeys.
- Frame selection: compute tight/loose bounding sphere and move camera.

JSON Ops v1
- Complete ops per schema and proposals: add_light, duplicate, remove (alias of delete), set_camera_preset, orbit_camera, frame_object, select, set_background, exposure, tone_map.
- Strict validation: integrate schemas/json_ops_v1.json with a validator behind --strict-schema.
- Examples: expand examples/json-ops/ with each op demonstrated and golden images for CI.

Headless CLI
- Flags: --asset-root, --seed, --strict-schema, --log warn|info|debug.
- Exit codes: stable codes for success, validation error, runtime error, file IO error.
- Logging: timestamped, structured messages; quiet mode for CI.

Desktop UI (ImGui)
- Scene tree: hierarchical list, select/delete/duplicate, rename, icons.
- Selection highlights: already present; add material/outline options and thickness control.
- Transform gizmo: snapping (grid/angle), world/local toggle (present), per-axis numeric inputs.
- Drag-drop: from OS onto viewport and Scene tree; accept model and scene JSON.
- Recent files: persisted MRU with thumbnails where available.
- Camera presets: toolbar buttons + hotkeys; status bar readout.
- Performance HUD: show draw calls, tris, textures/materials, VRAM estimates.

Assets and Materials
- Asset root search rules; cache warming; sRGB/linear conversions verified end-to-end.
- Optional KTX2 usage on desktop and web with graceful fallback.

Web
- Embed SDK stabilization: versioning, API docs, and error surfaces.
- Viewer state import/export with ?state= base64 and addressable assets.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (KEY ITEMS)

- Directional light: can be added via UI and JSON ops; shader path produces expected shading on standard PBR test scenes; persists via JSON ops/state share-link; selectable indicator arrow; UI controls to enable/disable and edit direction & intensity. Golden image in CI: PENDING.
- Spot light: can be added via UI and JSON ops; shader path applies inverse-square attenuation and smooth inner/outer cone falloff; UI can edit position, direction, inner/outer cone angles, and intensity. Persisted via JSON ops/state share-link.
- Camera presets: selecting any preset yields the same camera pose for a given target independent of prior state; hotkeys 1-8 map consistently; JSON set_camera_preset works.
- MSAA resolve: --samples=N reduces edge aliasing vs N=1; at N=1 colors bit-match the non-MSAA path.
- Strict schema: invalid ops file fails fast with non-zero exit code and clear message; CI step fails accordingly.
- Determinism: same ops + seed produce the same image hash on identical hardware; cross-vendor SSIM >= 0.995 (Web vs Desktop >= 0.990).

---

## QA TEST PLAN

- Unit-adjacent: where feasible, isolate math/utility (e.g., camera preset calculations) and test deterministically.
- Headless E2E: run glint --ops ... --render out.png --w 256 --h 256 for each example; verify output exists and matches schema.
- Visual regression: compare out.png with golden.png using SSIM. Thresholds: default SSIM >= 0.995 or max per-channel delta <= 2 LSB; Web vs Desktop allow SSIM >= 0.990. Upload diff and heatmap artifacts on failure.
- CLI validation: negative tests for unknown flags, bad JSON, missing assets, and schema violations when --strict-schema is on.
- UI smoke: scripted sequences (if available) or manual checklist for menus, toggles, presets, and drag-drop once implemented.

CI Integration (proposed)
- Add a validate job to .github/workflows/ci.yml that runs schema checks and headless renders against examples with golden comparisons; upload diffs.

---

## SCHEMA VALIDATION POLICY

- CLI flags: --strict-schema (fail on unknown fields), --schema-version v1.3.
- Canonicalization: when writing ops, produce a canonical JSON (sorted keys, fixed float precision) so diffs are stable and CI reviews are meaningful.
- Validation: schema violations exit with code 2 and a precise error pointer (path to offending field).

---

## SECURITY AND ROBUSTNESS TESTS

- Path traversal: reject .. that escapes --asset-root.
- Oversized textures/OOM: clamp sizes and error cleanly with message; no crash.
- Malformed assets (glTF/OBJ): resilient loaders with actionable errors; fuzz small samples.
- Web: strong CSP, no cross-origin reads without explicit opt-in, no eval in UI.

---

## PACKAGING ACCEPTANCE

- macOS: notarization verified on a clean VM; app launches without quarantine prompts.
- Windows: SmartScreen friendly (signed if possible); no unknown publisher warnings in release pipelines.
- Artifacts include: LICENSE, third-party notices, checksums (SHA256) for binaries.

---

## ROADMAP

- M1 (Core parity): Directional light, camera presets, JSON Ops v1 completion for core ops, strict schema in CLI, baseline golden tests.
- M2 (Quality): MSAA offscreen + UI, orbit/framing, scene tree and selection panel, drag-drop, recent files, expanded HUD.
- M3 (Lighting): Spot lights, HDR skybox loading, IBL stubs and integration, tone mapping/exposure controls and CLI flags.
- M4 (Polish and Web): Embed SDK hardening, asset resolution (--asset-root), deterministic seed in raytracer and raster; packaging scripts.

---

## RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

- Platform drift (GL versions, WebGL2 limits): maintain shader compatibility paths and automated smoke tests on Linux + Emscripten.
- Visual test flakiness: use tolerance windows and seed control; keep reference scenes minimal and deterministic.
- Asset path variability: introduce --asset-root and normalize relative paths in examples; document required assets.
- Performance regressions: track HUD metrics across builds; consider simple timing logs in headless mode.
